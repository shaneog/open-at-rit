# A Location at RIT. Every Location has a name, two lists of hours (one for
# during the week, another for during the weekend), and an optional description
# (displayed in a tooltip in the view, if there is one). Location data should
# not frequently change at runtime, because the appropriate data is created in a
# database seed. If a location is always closed during weekdays and/or weekends,
# the appropriate times will be set to nil.

  # time). Each Integer represents the number of seconds after midnight that the
  # Location opens or closes.
